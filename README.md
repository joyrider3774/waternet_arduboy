# Waternet Multiplatform Retro Game
This is the Arduboy version of my Waternet games which is a multiplatform puzzle game initially written for old consoles and handhelds like Game Boy (Color), Game Gear, Master System, Analogue Pocket and Mega Duck using the gbdk sdk. This a port with many changes to make it work for arduboy

## Game Modes
The aim of the game, in any game mode is always to connect all pipes so that water can flow through them from the water point source. How you can accomplish this depends on the  game mode. The game has a help section in the main menu where you can always check up on the rules of each game mode.

### Rotate Mode

## Graphics 
Graphics (tiles), i converted using the [Gimp Image Editor](https://www.gimp.org/) and the [Gimp tilemap gb plugin](https://github.com/bbbbbr/gimp-tilemap-gb) from the gameboy tiles created in [Game Boy Tile Designer](http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html) and the titlescreen graphic is based on a modified title screen image from my waternet game i made for [gp2x](https://www.willemssoft.be/index.php?main=5&sub=6&action=productdetails&id=218) and [windows](https://www.willemssoft.be/index.php?main=46&sub=7&action=productdetails&id=220). I designed the title screen in the [Gimp Image Editor](https://www.gimp.org/) to just have the word waternet and the waterdrop. Afterwards i used Team ARG [Cabi](https://github.com/Team-ARG-Museum/Cabi) to convert the titlescreen to an RLE encoded bitmap as a constant. 

## Sound
Sound are single tones generated using the beepin2 class from [Arduboy2](https://github.com/MLXXXp/Arduboy2) library

## Music
Music was made using [Online Sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/), i created single channel, non mixed music files and later converted this music to an array storing the frequencies of notes to be used on the arduboy. I got [this idea](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/making-a-game-boy-game-in-2017-a-quot-sheep-it-up-quot-post-mortem-part-2-2-) from the [sheep it up](https://gamejolt.com/games/sheepitup/267335) game developed by Dr. Ludos. He stored the frequencies to be used for the music notes in a array. So i used the same system and all i had todo was convert the music from onlinesequencer i made to such array (by hand) as well.
The music is played using the [Arduboy tones library](https://github.com/MLXXXp/ArduboyTones)

You can find the music files i used for the game below:

* Game Music: [https://onlinesequencer.net/2485064](https://onlinesequencer.net/2485064)
* Title Music: [https://onlinesequencer.net/2484977](https://onlinesequencer.net/2484977)
* Level Done Tune: [https://onlinesequencer.net/2484974](https://onlinesequencer.net/2484974)

## EEPROM
The game uses EEPROM for saving it's progress, you can find and change these values in [savestate.cpp](source/waternet/src/savestate.cpp)

| Start address | End address | Bytes used |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 493           | 505         | 13         |

## Credits
Waternet game concept is based on the Net and Netslide game from the [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/),
it's my own implementation of these 2 game concepts mixed into one game
